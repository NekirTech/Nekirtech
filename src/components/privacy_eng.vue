    <b>Data protection</b>
    <p>
      The use of this website (nekir.tech) is usually possible without providing
      personal data. If we ask for any data (for example name, address, email
      addresses, in the context of a goods order, opening and with registration
      for our newsletter) it is only on a voluntary basis (see ยง 13 TMG). The
      sensitive data will not be disclosed to third parties without your express
      consent. We point out that data transmission over the Internet (eg
      communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of
      data against access by third parties is not possible. The sending of not
      expressly requested advertising and information materials through the use
      of contact data, which are disclosed in the context of fulfilling the
      imprint obligation pursuant to ยง 5 TMG, is hereby expressly prohibited. We
      expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the
      unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam mails
      (especially newsletters).
